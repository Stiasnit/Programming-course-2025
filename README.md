# Programming-course-2025
Purpose of code:
  Simulating particle production expected by a specific model commonly used in particle physics using Python 3

Questions that will be answered:
  What are the average counts of each particle species and their statistical uncertainties?
  Is there any asymmetry between the particle and the anti-particle?
  Is there any asymmetry as a function of their momentum?

Data included:
  5 million pp collisions at âˆšs = 14 TeV

This code requires the installation of pandas https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
