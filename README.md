# Programming-course-2025: Particle Physics
Purpose of code:
  Simulating particle production expected by a specific model commonly used in particle physics using Python 3.
  This code requires the installation of pandas https://pypi.org/project/pandas/.

Questions that will be answered:
  1)What are the average counts of each particle species and their statistical uncertainties?
  2)Is there any asymmetry between the particle and the anti-particle?
  3)Is there any asymmetry as a function of their momentum?

Data included:
  - 5 million pp collisions at âˆšs = 14 TeV across
  - 11 output files containing 500k collisions each
  - 6 particles and their anti-particles
  - Momentum calulations for each group of particles
  - Number of events each particle appeared
  - Average number of each particle per event
  - Statisitcal Uncertainity and Standard Deviation of particles per event
